My name is Vasilena Mincheva and this is my bug repository.
It contains a collection of bugs found in various software projects.
Each report contains the software version numbers, a brief description of the error, how it was reproduced and a video of the bug if available.
The purpose of this repository is to help me keep track of bugs I find and practice reporting them.
